    <h3><u>introduction:</u></h3>
  <p style="font-family:san-serif";>Everyone here in the EARTH earns money for food.There are many people who are not eating food even one time a day.A human requires meals three times a day
      but due to poverty many people in INDIA  are not having the food. They are begging in roads with the small kidS and if they  get money they eat orelse they are sleeping with empty
      stomach which leads their body weak and even leading to death.The death by this is very large and it should have a solution.As India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, poverty is on the decline in the country, with close to 44 Indians escaping extreme poverty every minute, as per the World Poverty Clock. India has been able to lift a significant percentage of its population out of poverty, but many still live in it. India had 73 million people living in extreme poverty which makes up 5.5% of its total population, according to the Brookings report. In May 2012, the World Bank reviewed and proposed revisions to their poverty calculation methodology and purchasing power parity basis for measuring poverty worldwide. It was a minimal 3.6% in terms of percentage. As of 2016, the incidence of multidimensional poverty has almost halved between 2005–06 and 2015–16, declining from 54.7 percent to 27.5 percent

<h3><u>causes of poverty:</u></h3>
<p style="font-family:san-serif";>High population growth rate is one of major reasons of poverty in India. This further leads to high level of illiteracy, poor health care facilities and lack of access to financial resources. Also, high population growth affects the per capita income and makes per capita income even lower. It is expected that population in India will reach 1.5 billion by 2026 and then India will be the largest nation in the world. But India’s economy is not growing at the same pace. This means shortage of jobs. For this much population, near about 20 million new jobs would be required. Number of poor will keep on increasing if such a big number of jobs won’t be created.

Ever increasing prices of even basic commodities is another reason of poverty. A person below the poverty line finds it difficult to survive. Caste system and unequal distribution of income and resources is another reason of poverty in India.

Apart from all these, unskilled workers are paid very low in spite of hard work they put daily. The problem lies with the unorganized sector as owners do not bother the way their workers live and the amount they earn. Their area of concern is just cost-cutting and more profit. Because of the number of workers looking for a job is higher than the jobs available, unskilled workers have no other option but to work for less money. The government should really find a way to impose minimum wage standards for these workers. At the same time, the government should ensure that this is implemented well.

Poverty must be eradicated from India as every person has the right to live a healthy life.</p>

  <h3><u>who comes under poverty?</u></h3>
    <p style="font-family:san-serif";>Tribal people, Dalits and labour class including farm workers in villages and casual workers in cities are still very poor and make the poorest class in INDIA
</p>
<h3><u>FACTS OF POVERTY:</u></h3>
<p>The overall number of poor in India is still increasing and becoming a hurdle. Poverty is just like a disease to which many other problems such as crime, low-paced development, etc are associated. There are number of people in India who still live on the streets and beg for the whole day to eat a meal. Underprivileged children are unable to attend school and, and those have the opportunity drop out after a year or so. People below poverty line live in unhygienic conditions and are so prone to many health problems. With this, the vicious cycle of poor health, lack of education and more poverty keeps on increasing.one important reason for poverty is the existence of large inequalities in wealth, such as land in villages and assets like shares, property etc in urban areas.
The distribution of these assets being unequal, the income that flow from these are also very unequal.

<h3><u>Where do the majority of poor live in India?</u></p>
  <p style="font-family:san-serif";>60% of the poor still reside in the states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The reason for these states to be in the category of the poorest state is because 85% of tribal people live there. Also, most of these regions are either flood-prone or suffer from calamities.
     These conditions hamper agriculture to a great extent, on which the household income of these groups depends.
